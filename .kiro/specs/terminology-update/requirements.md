# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating the terminology throughout the TR-181 Node Comparator project to replace "Subset definitions" with "Operator Requirement definitions". This change reflects a more accurate description of the functionality and aligns with industry terminology where operators define specific requirements for TR-181 implementations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the TR-181 Node Comparator, I want to update all terminology from "Subset definitions" to "Operator Requirement definitions" so that the project uses more accurate and industry-standard terminology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN all references to "subset definitions" SHALL be replaced with "operator requirement definitions"
2. WHEN reviewing code comments and docstrings THEN all references to "subset" in the context of definitions SHALL be replaced with "operator requirement"
3. WHEN reviewing variable names and function names THEN all references to "subset" SHALL be updated to "operator_requirement" or similar appropriate naming
4. WHEN reviewing configuration examples THEN all references to subset files SHALL be updated to operator requirement files
5. WHEN reviewing CLI commands and help text THEN all references to subset SHALL be updated to operator-requirement

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user of the TR-181 Node Comparator CLI, I want the command-line interface to use the updated terminology so that I can understand the tool's purpose more clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using CLI commands THEN command names SHALL reflect "operator-requirement" instead of "subset"
2. WHEN viewing help text THEN all descriptions SHALL use "operator requirement" terminology
3. WHEN using configuration files THEN file extensions and naming SHALL reflect the new terminology
4. WHEN viewing error messages THEN they SHALL use the updated terminology

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with the TR-181 Node Comparator API, I want the API to use consistent terminology so that the integration is clear and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Python API classes THEN class names SHALL reflect "OperatorRequirement" instead of "Subset"
2. WHEN calling API methods THEN method names SHALL use "operator_requirement" terminology
3. WHEN receiving API responses THEN field names SHALL use the updated terminology
4. WHEN handling configuration objects THEN they SHALL use "OperatorRequirementConfig" naming

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user reading project documentation, I want all documentation to use consistent terminology so that I can understand the project's purpose and functionality clearly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading README.md THEN all references SHALL use "Operator Requirement definitions"
2. WHEN reading API documentation THEN terminology SHALL be consistent throughout
3. WHEN reading example configurations THEN they SHALL demonstrate operator requirement files
4. WHEN reading troubleshooting guides THEN they SHALL reference operator requirements appropriately
