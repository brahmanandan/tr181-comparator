# TR181 Node Comparator - Error Handling and Recovery System

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive error handling and recovery system for the TR181 Node Comparator project. This system provides robust error management, retry logic with exponential backoff, graceful degradation for partial data scenarios, and comprehensive error reporting.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Custom Exception Classes

**Base Exception Class:**
- `TR181Error`: Base exception class with enhanced error reporting, context information, severity levels, and recovery suggestions

**Specific Exception Classes:**
- `ConnectionError`: For network connectivity and connection establishment failures
- `ValidationError`: For data integrity issues and constraint violations
- `AuthenticationError`: For authentication and authorization failures
- `TimeoutError`: For operation timeout scenarios
- `ProtocolError`: For protocol-specific communication errors
- `ConfigurationError`: For invalid or missing configuration issues

### 2. Error Context and Metadata

**ErrorContext Class:**
- Tracks operation details, component information, attempt numbers, and custom metadata
- Provides structured context for debugging and error analysis

**ErrorCategory and ErrorSeverity Enums:**
- Categorizes errors for better classification and handling
- Defines severity levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL) for appropriate response

**RecoveryAction Class:**
- Defines suggested recovery actions for each error type
- Supports both automatic and manual recovery suggestions

### 3. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff

**RetryManager Class:**
- Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff
- Jitter support to prevent thundering herd problems
- Selective retry based on exception types
- Comprehensive logging of retry attempts

**RetryConfig Class:**
- Configurable parameters for retry behavior
- Base delay, maximum delay, backoff factor, and jitter settings
- Customizable list of retryable exception types

### 4. Graceful Degradation Manager

**GracefulDegradationManager Class:**
- Handles partial success scenarios gracefully
- Configurable minimum success rate thresholds
- Detailed reporting of successful and failed operations
- Support for both synchronous and asynchronous operations

**PartialResult Class:**
- Tracks successful and failed items in batch operations
- Automatic success rate calculation
- Acceptability checking against minimum thresholds

### 5. Error Reporting and Monitoring

**ErrorReporter Class:**
- Centralized error logging with appropriate severity levels
- Error history tracking and analysis
- Time-windowed error summaries
- Structured logging with error context

**Global Error Reporter:**
- Singleton pattern for system-wide error reporting
- Easy integration across all components
- Consistent error tracking and analysis

## Integration with Existing Components

### Updated Extractors Module

- Integrated comprehensive error handling into the base `NodeExtractor` class
- Enhanced `SubsetManager` with proper error handling for file operations
- Updated `HookBasedDeviceExtractor` initialization to include retry and degradation managers
- Improved error messages with context and recovery suggestions

### Enhanced Error Handling in Operations

- File I/O operations with proper error handling and recovery
- Network operations with retry logic and timeout handling
- Data validation with detailed error reporting
- Configuration loading with comprehensive error checking

## Testing

### Comprehensive Unit Tests

Created `tests/test_error_handling.py` with 31 test cases covering:

- **TR181Error Base Class Tests:**
  - Basic error creation and serialization
  - Error context propagation
  - User-friendly message generation
  - Recovery action suggestions

- **Specific Error Type Tests:**
  - ConnectionError with endpoint and timeout details
  - ValidationError with validation details and node paths
  - AuthenticationError with authentication method tracking
  - TimeoutError with operation and duration information
  - ProtocolError with protocol-specific details
  - ConfigurationError with configuration key tracking

- **RetryManager Tests:**
  - Successful operations without retry
  - Retry logic with retryable exceptions
  - Non-retryable exception handling
  - Maximum attempts exhaustion
  - Exponential backoff delay calculation
  - Delay capping and jitter handling

- **GracefulDegradationManager Tests:**
  - All items successful scenarios
  - Acceptable partial success handling
  - Unacceptable success rate handling
  - Both sync and async operation support

- **Error Reporting Tests:**
  - Error history tracking
  - Time-windowed error summaries
  - Global error reporter functionality
  - Structured error logging

### Integration Tests

Created `tests/test_error_integration.py` with integration scenarios:

- SubsetManager error handling with file operations
- Device extractor retry logic and connection failures
- Graceful degradation with partial failures
- Error reporting integration across components
- Standalone component testing
- Error context propagation through the system

- Comprehensive retry attempt logging

### 4. Graceful Degradation
- Configurable success rate thresholds
- Detailed partial result tracking
- Support for both sync and async operations
- Intelligent failure analysis

### 5. Advanced Error Reporting

## Usage Examples

### Basic Error Handling
```python
from tr181_comparator.errors import ConnectionError, ErrorContext

context = ErrorContext(
    operation="device_connection",
    component="DeviceExtractor"
)

try:
    # Some operation that might fail
    result = await connect_to_device()
except Exception as e:
    raise ConnectionError(
        message="Failed to connect to device",
        endpoint="http://device.local",
        context=context,
        cause=e
    )
```

### Retry Logic
```python
from tr181_comparator.errors import RetryManager, RetryConfig

retry_manager = RetryManager(
    config=RetryConfig(
        max_attempts=3,
        base_delay=1.0,
        backoff_factor=2.0
    )
)

result = await retry_manager.execute_with_retry(
    risky_operation,
    "operation_name"
)
```

### Graceful Degradation
```python
from tr181_comparator.errors import GracefulDegradationManager

degradation_manager = GracefulDegradationManager(min_success_rate=0.7)

result = await degradation_manager.execute_with_partial_success(
    items=parameter_list,
    operation=process_parameter,
    operation_name="parameter_processing"
)
```

- `tests/test_error_handling.py` - Comprehensive unit tests (31 test cases)
- `tests/test_error_integration.py` - Integration tests (9 test scenarios)

### Modified Files:
- `tr181_comparator/__init__.py` - Updated exports to include error classes

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ **1.4**: Comprehensive error handling with specific error messages and recovery suggestions
✅ **4.4**: Retry logic with exponential backoff for connection failures  
✅ **6.4**: Graceful degradation for partial data scenarios
✅ **7.4**: Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms

All unit tests pass (31/31) and the error handling system is fully functional and ready for integration with the rest of the TR181 Node Comparator system.

## Next Steps

The error handling and recovery system is complete and ready for use. Future tasks can integrate this system more deeply into existing components like:

1. CWMP extractor implementation (Task 13)
2. Integration tests (Task 14) 
3. CLI interface (Task 15)
4. Logging and monitoring (Task 16)

The system provides a solid foundation for robust error handling throughout the entire TR181 Node Comparator application.
